Various hack me challenges posted on OSAC's facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/groups/osacchat/) with the following message

*******************

## hackme1


`hackme1` was to know string password hard-coded in program just by using `cat` or `strings` commands. <br/>


*******************

## hackme2


 `hackme2` was to exploite buffer overflow vernability.<br/>
  When given long string as password it overwrite the flag and set it as true.<br/>
  And program behave as if correct password is entered.

## hackme3

```
Hackers! Are you ready to face a challenge?<br/>
This is a program compiled for linux. Which

-> accepts an integer from command line argument .
-> compares that argv with a pre-stored 4-digit integer.
-> prints a msg and returns 0 if they match
-> returns 1 if they don't match


Write a program to find that pre-stored 4-digit number(pass-pin) using brute force. PM me the code.

## hackme4

```

hackme!
This attached file named 'wps' is a simple c program compiled for 32-bit Linux system which accepts 8-digit integer (passcode) as argument.
Its behaviour is similar to that of the wps(the flaw on which is exploited by tools like reaver for hacking wifi password).
It returns
-> 2 when the no passcode is provided or the provided passcode is incorrect
-> 0 when the passcode provided is correct
-> 1 when any half(lower or upper 4-digits) match
The task is to write a program/script to find the passcode. 
(Message me the passcode and your code.)

```
