A challenge to hack a demo program with brute force attack

This is a program compiled for linux. Which
```
-> accepts an integer from command line argument .
-> compares that argv with a pre-stored 4-digit integer.
-> prints a msg and returns 0 if they match
-> returns 1 if they don't match
```

Write a program to find that pre-stored 4-digit number(pass-pin) using brute force. PM me the code.
