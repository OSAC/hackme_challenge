A challenge posted on OSAC's facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/groups/osacchat/) with the following message


Hackers! Are you ready to face a challenge?<br/>
This is a program compiled for linux. Which
```
-> accepts an integer from command line argument .
-> compares that argv with a pre-stored 4-digit integer.
-> prints a msg and returns 0 if they match
-> returns 1 if they don't match
```

Write a program to find that pre-stored 4-digit number(pass-pin) using brute force. PM me the code.
